# Low-collateral sidechain bridge
## Abstract
This paper takes the idea of Statechains, which were originally designed as a scaling mechanism for Bitcoin and uses it as the basis for a protocol that enables porting of tokens between blockchains. The protocol is further secured through the use of collateral that gets slashed in the case of misbehaviour.
